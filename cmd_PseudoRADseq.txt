# Quick script to perform "Pseudo" RAD-Seq using RNA/DNA sequences

# Find lines that start with CAATTC. 
# GREP prints the 2 lines before and 1 line after
# Use zgrep so that we donâ€™t have to uncompress everything first.
zgrep -a -A 2 -B 1 "^CAATTC" BleSp_P1.fastq.gz #1

# Delete the pesky dashes that grep leaves behind to delimit every hit
sed -E 's/--//g' RAD_BleSp_P1.fastq #2

# Delete empty lines (There probably is a way to combine steps 1 and 2.
sed -E '/^$/d' > RAD_BleSp_P1.fq #3

# Piped here for convenience
zgrep -a -A 2 -B 1 "^CAATTC" BleDi_P1.fastq.gz | sed -E 's/--//g' | sed -E '/^$/d' > RobertRAD/RAD_BleDi_P1.fq
