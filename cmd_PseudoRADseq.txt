# Quick script to perform "Pseudo" RAD-Seq using RNA/DNA sequences

# Find lines that start with CAATTC. 
# GREP prints the 2 lines before and 1 line after
# Use zgrep so that we do not have to uncompress everything first.

zgrep -a --no-group-separator -A 2 -B 1 "^CAATTC" BarRo_P1.fastq.gz > RobertRAD/RAD_BarRo_P1.fq

# Can also be done with grep alone.
